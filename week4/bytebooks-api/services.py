"""
services.py - Service Layer for ByteBooks API
==============================================

This module contains the business logic layer of the application. Routes
in main.py act as thin wrappers that delegate all real work here.

Each service class groups related operations and exposes them as static
methods so callers never need to instantiate a service object.

Design principles:
  - All DB queries and validation live here, not in routes.
  - All error conditions raise HTTPException with appropriate status codes.
  - Methods receive an open Session and commit/refresh as needed.
