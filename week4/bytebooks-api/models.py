models.py - SQLModel Database Models
======================================

SQLModel is a library created by the same author as FastAPI (Sebastián
Ramírez). It combines two powerful libraries into one:

  1. SQLAlchemy  – the most popular Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
  2. Pydantic    – the most popular Python data-validation library

This means a single SQLModel class serves as:
  - A database table definition  (like SQLAlchemy models)
  - A request/response schema    (like Pydantic models)
  - A data validator             (type checking, constraints)

Why use SQLModel?
  - Write your model ONCE and use it everywhere (DRY principle)
  - Full type-hint support for editor auto-completion
  - Automatic JSON serialization for API responses
  - Built-in validation (max_length, ge, unique, etc.)

    Attributes:

        bio:        Short biography (optional).

        books:      One-to-many relationship – one author can have many books.

    Relationships:
        Author.books  ←→  Book.author
        This is a *bidirectional* relationship. When you load an Author,
        you can access author.books to get all their Book objects, and
        when you load a Book, you can access book.author to get the
        Author object. SQLModel/SQLAlchemy handles the JOIN automatically.

        The foreign key `author_id` stores the Author's primary key.

        into a full Author object via a JOIN query.
